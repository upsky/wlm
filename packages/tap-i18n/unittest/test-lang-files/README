Testing Languages
=================

To make testing intuitive and easy we formed pseudo languages files with the
following rules:

keys are: a01, a02, ..., a99

en: The en language translates all the keys and their translations is identical
to the key:
{
    a01: a01,
    a02: a02,
    .
    .
    .
    a99: a99
}

except for en all the other languages are pseudo and their tags are: bb, cc, dd

They translate the keys by changing the first letter to their tag-name letter:

bb: {
    a01: b01,
    a02: b02,
    .
    .
    .
    a09: b09,
    a11: b11,
    a12: b12,
    .
    .
    .
}

cc language has a dialect: cc-CC

The translations are the same as cc but capitalized, and every 5th key is missing to allow fall-back testing:

cc-CC: {
    a01: C01,
    a02: C02,
    a03: C03,
    a04: C04,
    a06: C06,
    a07: C07,
    a08: C08,
    a08: C09,
    a11: C11,
    .
    .
    .
}
